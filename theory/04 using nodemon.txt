Nodemon is a library that can be used for backend developments.
It is responsible for automatically restarting the server when code changes were made.
It can be installed via:
    npm install nodemon --save-dev

To use it adjust the package.json file.
Adjust the value of script "Start" to "start":"nodemon app.js" instead of "start":"node app.js"

Restart debugger automatically with each code change:
Therefore go to "Run -> Add configuration" Node.js
add parameter
    "restart":true,
    "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon"


In addition you can add the following to print the console.logs to the integrated terminal
    "console":"integratedTerminal"


finally the configuration looked like the following:
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
            "restart":true,
            "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon",
            "console":"integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]

Probably the application can be started by using "node app.js"
But if the app.js isnt found check: 
    1. if your code was compiled
    2. is the package.json config correct. Does the "start" script points to the app.js. E.g. if the compiled code is located in dist/* the start script parameter must set to "start":"dist/app.js"
    3. nodemon wasn't found. It can be solved by installing nodemon globally
    4. use command "npm start" to start the server
