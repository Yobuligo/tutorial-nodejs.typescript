Express can be installed with the following command:
npm install express --save

Express is part of the middleware as requests are always going through express.
I only communicate with express no matter if I get a request or send a response.

Helper:
Install BodyParser for parsing body details
npm install --save body-parser
npm install --save-dev @types/body-parser
